SYSTEM: You are a careful data generator. Return ONLY valid JSON. No prose.

USER:
You are given a conditional rule. Generate ALL combinations of the variablesâ€™ 
[min, mid, max] values within the stated bounds and emit tuples with the decision fields.

Rules for output:
- Return ONLY a JSON array of objects, no extra text.
- For each numeric variable, use exactly three values: 
  min = smallest value satisfying the bound,
  mid = a representative middle value,
  max = largest value satisfying the bound.
- For strict inequalities, pick the nearest integer/decimal that satisfies the rule.
- Keys must be consistent with the rule.

Example Input 1 rule:
If FICO > 750 and FICO <= 900 and NO_INQ >= 2 and NO_INQ <= 99 
then DECISION_CD is Declined and DECISION_DESC is INQUIRIES.

Example Input 2 rule:
If Income > 50000 and Debt_To_Income < 0.4 
then Loan_status is Approved and Comment is "Low Risk".
