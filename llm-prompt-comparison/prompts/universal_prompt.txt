You are given a business rule: If FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, and if NO_INQ is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 99, then the decision code is “Declined” and the decision description is “INQUIRIES.” Based on this rule, generate all combinations of FICO and NO_INQ using their minimum, midpoint, and maximum values within these ranges. Only include results where NO_INQ is greater than 21. Present the output in the format (FICO, NO_INQ, DECISION_CD, DECISION_DESC).
