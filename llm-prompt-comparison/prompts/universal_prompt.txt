SYSTEM: You are a careful data generator.

USER:
You are given a conditional rule. Follow it to generate all combinations of min, mid, and max values for each numeric variable. 
Use bounds exactly as stated in the rule.
Given the condition: If FICO > 750 and FICO <= 900 and NO_INQ >= 2 and NO_INQ <= 99 then DECISION_CD is 'Declined' and DECISION_DESC is 'INQUIRIES'.
Generate all combinations of min, mid, max for FICO and NO_INQ within these bounds.
Output in format: (FICO, NO_INQ, DECISION_CD, DECISION_DESC)
