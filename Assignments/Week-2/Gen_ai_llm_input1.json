The condition specifies ranges for FICO and NO_INQ.  We need to generate combinations representing the minimum, middle, and maximum values within those ranges.

**FICO:**

* Minimum: 751
* Middle: 825 (approximately the middle of 751-900)
* Maximum: 900

**NO_INQ:**

* Minimum: 2
* Middle: 50 (approximately the middle of 2-99)
* Maximum: 99


This gives us a total of 3 x 3 = 9 combinations. Here's the output in the requested format:

(751, 2, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(751, 50, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(751, 99, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(825, 2, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(825, 50, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(825, 99, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(900, 2, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(900, 50, Declined, INQUIRIES)
(900, 99, Declined, INQUIRIES)
