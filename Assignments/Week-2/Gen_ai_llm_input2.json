The condition only specifies when a loan is approved and the comment is 'Low Risk'.  There are infinitely many combinations that satisfy this condition.  Here are a few examples to illustrate:


* **(60000, 0.3, Approved, Low Risk)**  (Income > 50000 and Debt_To_Income < 0.4)
* **(50001, 0.39, Approved, Low Risk)** (Income > 50000 and Debt_To_Income < 0.4)
* **(100000, 0.2, Approved, Low Risk)** (Income > 50000 and Debt_To_Income < 0.4)
* **(55000, 0.35, Approved, Low Risk)** (Income > 50000 and Debt_To_Income < 0.4)


To represent all possibilities concisely, we can use mathematical notation:

**(Income, Debt_To_Income, Loan_status, comment)  where Income > 50000 and 0 â‰¤ Debt_To_Income < 0.4 and Loan_status = 'Approved' and comment = 'Low Risk'**

This notation captures all combinations that meet the criteria.  Any specific numerical examples would only be a subset of this infinite set.
